This app uses the svelte-template app as a base. All the components are built from scratch in svelte, with the markdown being rendered with preprocessor svelte-preprocessor-markdown. One of the very fun things with this project was figuring out how to get MathJax to work in conjunction with Markdown. In the end, I was able to get it working, allowing for mathematics to be used in markdown, as well as being able to imbed javascript/html into the page with svelte components. This led to a very flexible way of writing documents that is also highly modular!
